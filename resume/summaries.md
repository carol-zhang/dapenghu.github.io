# Known improvement method

## DASH
  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) and SmoothStreaming,
  Google claims that integrating ExoPlayer in Play Movies allowed them to reduce startup 
  playback latency by 65% and decreasing rebuffering by 40%.

## Smooth streaming

  The Silverlight browser plug-in allows you to see the IIS Smooth Streaming player on this page. 
  If the Internet bandwidth and video rendering capability on your playback device are sufficiently high, you'll experience high-definition video playback of the sample content. 
  You will also be able to simulate end user experiences under varying conditions by simulating drops and recoveries in bandwidth. If your actual bandwidth is below 3 Mbps, or your playback device is video-challenged, then you will experience the adaptive nature of Smooth Streaming without needing to simulate a bandwidth cap. 
  If you have high bandwidth and modern hardware, you might also try the 1080p page.
